# Kotlin Tourist
Learning Kotlin by taking a tour.

## Hello, World
See [app.kt](src/app.kt) for the canonical example.

## Pattern Matching
Kotlin does not have pattern matching as we know it from the `match x with ...` expression in F# or OCaml which combines pattern matching and destructuring bindings.

It does have something similar in the form of the `when` expression.
See [pattern matching examples](src/patternmatching/withenums/MatchOnEnums.kt).
